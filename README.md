# HoriseonEdit
On this website I have changed all the div tags to what I believe are the proper syntaxes. I also changed the three div tags on the css to different syntaxes as well. Comments have been added to both the html and the css to better organize the code and make it easier to follow. Lastly, alts have been added to all images within the code in order to follow accessibility standards as requested.
Below are a picture of the website and the website url.
